Replicating a game chip on an app over the weekend. Let the hacking begin!

### Overall Specs
> Generate a raondom number( 0 to 9 ) for each player <br> 
> Skip play - no pints detected<br>
> Allow players to see the next 2 random digits<br>
> Either play by adding or overwrite on the existing number<br>
> Player earns points by creating an adjacency<br>
> F is the largest value to play<br>
> If the number is larger than F, there will be a display overflow and the the result will be the number - 16<br>
example, E + 9 = 7 ( 14 + 9 - 16)<br>


### UI Specs
> 4 digit display for each player<br>
> Skip Button<br>
> Add/Replace Button<br>
